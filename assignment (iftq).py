# Problem Statement:

---

A university wants to automate their admission process. Students are admitted based on marks scored in a qualifying exam. A student is identified by their student ID, age, and marks in the qualifying exam. Data are considered valid if the age is greater than 20 and the marks are between 0 and 100 (both inclusive). A student qualifies for admission if both the age and marks are valid, and the marks are 65 or more.

You are required to write a Python program to represent the students seeking admission in the university. The details of the student class are given below:

**Class Name**: `Student`
**Attributes (Private)**:

* `student_id`
* `marks`
* `age`

**Methods (Public)**:

* `__init__()` – Create and initialize all instance variables to `None`.
* `validate_marks()` – If data is valid (i.e., marks are between 0 and 100), return `True`; else, return `False`.
* `validate_age()` – If age is greater than 20, return `True`; else, return `False`.
* `check_qualification()` – First validate marks and age. If both are valid and marks are 65 or more, return `True`; otherwise, return `False`.
* Setter methods – Include setter methods for all instance variables to set their values.
* Getter methods – Include getter methods for all instance variables to get their values.

---
 a student who is eligible for admission must choose a course and pay the fees for it. If the student has scored more than 85 marks in the qualifying exam, they get a 25% discount on the course fees.

The valid course IDs and corresponding fees are:

| Course ID | Fees    |
| --------- | ------- |
| 1001      | 25575.0 |
| 1002      | 15500.0 |

You are required to extend the program written in the previous assignment to include the above requirement.

The instance variables and methods to be included in the `Student` class for this extension are specified but not detailed in the original text. You will likely need to add attributes for `course_id` and `fees`, methods to validate the course, and a method to calculate discounted fees based on the marks.
